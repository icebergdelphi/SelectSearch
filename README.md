Extjs 4.x Grid Search with combo options


I bring to you, the Ext.ux.grid.SelectSearch plugin, developed since the beginning by Jozef Sakalos, aka Saki's grid search and modified recently for work with Extjs 4.x by Aaron Snyder,with the name:Ext.ux.grid.Search , so now i made some modifications for use it with a combobox options. Again, I am not the original author of this plugin and do not want credit for it, I simply made some modifications, this is compatible with ExtJS 4.x.

positionDock property is useful when we have a top toolbar or a pagingtoolbar + your grid in your desing.
